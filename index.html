        <p>Mage Squadron, officially the 508th Tactical Fighter Squadron, is an Osean Air Force unit assigned to
          the International Union Peacekeeping Force. The squadron saw deployment in the Lighthouse War.
        </p>
        <h4>History</h4>
        <p>
          On May 15, 2019, the Kingdom of Erusea declared war on the Osean Federation and attacked the
          country's bases all over Usea, including Fort Grays. Mage Squadron was scrambled with other allied
          squadrons to repel the Erusean air raid.
        </p>
        <p>
          The squadron also took part in halting the Erusean advance at the Scofields Plateau. During the
          operation, Erusean forces deployed multiple MQ-99s to engage the Osean aircraft, however, they were
          shot down by Golem and Mage Squadrons.
        </p>

        <p>
          On May 30, 2019, Mage Squadron took part in Operation Dual Wielder, where its objective was to help
          secure air superiority in the airspace over the Chopinburg Rainforest. The mission was almost a
          success, however, Erusea deployed an Arsenal Bird to quickly regain control of the region.[4]
        </p>
        <p>
          The last known sortie the squadron was involved in was Operation Lighthouse Keeper, where Osean
          forces had to infiltrate the city of Selatapura and rescue the Osean ex-president Vincent Harling
          from the Erusean-controlled International Space Elevator. The operation failed when Harling's
          transport helicopter was shot down and exploded, killing the ex-president. Trigger was blamed for
          killing the president, and was later court-martialed and sent to a penal air unit, Spare Squadron.

        <p>Strider Squadron, officially the 124th Tactical Fighter Squadron, and also referred to as the
          "Snowbirds", was a unit in Osean Air Defense Force's Long Range Strategic Strike Group (LRSSG).
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout the Lighthouse War, Strider Squadron became renowned for its many accomplishments, most notably
          defending Stonehenge and bringing down Arsenal Bird Liberty. Strider's actions often decided the outcome of
          many battles during the war.
        </p>
        <p>
          Strider Squadron was the player's squadron throughout the latter half of <em>Ace Combat 7: Skies
            Unknown</em>.
        </p>
        <h4>History</h4>
        <p>
          Following a reconnaissance mission to the Stonehenge ruins, Strider and Cyclops squadrons' return route
          changed to Yinshi Valley due to unknown factors. Shortly before entering the valley, they came under pursuit
          by Erusean MQ-99s, and Spare Squadron was deployed to cover their retreat. With Trigger acting as the rear
          guard, all Strider aircraft successfully exited the combat airspace. Following Trigger's engagement with
          Mister X, AWACS Bandog guided the LRSSG back to the 444th Air Base.
        </p>
        <h4>New Leadership</h4>
        <p>
          Following Operation Full House, Trigger, alongside his wingman Count, was transferred to the LRSSG under the
          request of Wiseman and was appointed the new flight lead of Strider Squadron.
        </p>
        <p>
          On August 10, 2019, aiming to weaken the Erusean Royal Navy, the LRSSG carried out a strategic strike on the
          Erusean forces stationed at Snider's Top. During the operation, Strider played a key role in sinking the Njord
          Fleet and destroying both military platforms. Initially, Strider's original members were skeptical of
          Trigger's leadership, however, after witnessing his skill during the operation, they wholly accepted their new
          leader. It was during the operation that Strider was first referred to as the "Snowbirds".
        </p>
        <h4>Counter Attack</h4>
        <p>
          Nine days later, Strider played a key role in defending the last remaining Stonehenge turret as it prepared to
          fire upon Arsenal Bird Liberty. After the railgun's spotter was rendered ineffective, Trigger, alongside
          Wiseman, crippled Liberty by destroying its main propellors, allowing Stonehenge to shoot it down.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the following operation, Operation Magic Spear, Strider alone was tasked with assisting Osean bombers in
          destroying Erusean IRBM silos by guiding the bombers' munitions to their targets. After destroying the main
          silos, it was revealed that Erusea had been hiding multiple IRBMs underneath a dam and subsequently launched
          the. Trigger ultimately shot down each missile before they reached critical altitude.

        <p>The 66th Air Force Unit "Galm", more commonly referred to as Galm Team, was a mercenary fighter squadron
          employed by the Ustio Air Force's 6th Air Division during the Belkan War. The two-man unit―comprised of a
          pilot known only by his callsign, "Cipher", and Larry Foulke―was stationed at Valais Air Base.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the course of the war, Galm Team shot down a considerable number of the Belkan Air Force's ace squadrons
          and pilots. The mercenary team's unparalleled combat efficiency proved highly advantageous to the Allied
          Forces during the war and decisively ended the postwar uprising orchestrated by A World With No Boundaries.
        </p>
        <h4>History</h4>
        <p>
          The specific details regarding Galm Team's creation are currently unknown. It is known that Larry Foulke
          (callsign, "Pixy") was employed by Ustio's foreign mercenary air division as early as 1994. Details
          concerning Cipher's recruitment remain unknown, though it can be surmised that he and Foulke were not
          introduced until their first combat sortie, during which they were designated Galm 1 and 2 respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          Galm Team's first known combat sortie occurred on April 2, 1995, when it was dispatched to intercept a Belkan
          bombing strike on Valais Air Base. Galm's successful defense of Valais ultimately prevented Belka from
          achieving complete hegemony over Ustio. Nearly two weeks later, Galm Team supported the Allied Forces'
          counteroffensive preparations by securing a military supply line along Route 171 in northern Sapin. On
          April 20, Galm Team underwent its first assignment within Area B7R. Although Galm's deployment was only
          intended to be a diversion to conceal the Allies' mobilization, the two mercenaries shot down all of the
          Belkan aircraft tasked with defending the airspace, including several ace squadrons.
        </p>
        <p>
          At 1458hrs, Foulke radioed through the electromagnetic interference and informed Cipher that he had "found a
          reason to fight"—he then proceeded to open fire on his flight leader. Cipher avoided his missile-fire and
          became entangled with several Belkan fighters, allowing Foulke to slip away in the confusion. Before
          departing, Foulke informed Cipher that the two of them must "go our separate ways." With Pixy listed as
          MIA, Crow Team's number three, Patrick James Beckett (callsign "PJ"), was reassigned to serve as Galm's number
          two.
        </p>
        <h4>End of the War</h4>
        <p>
          One week later, on June 13, Cipher and PJ were dispatched to engage the Belkan remnant forces massing near
          Mount Schirm. During the operation, Galm spotted an immense, empty hangar at a facility near the mountain, and
          PJ reported their findings back to Eagle Eye. The following week, Galm flew to Belka's northeast coast of
          Anfang to eliminate the remaining Belkan resistance forces. Although the operation was a success, the overall
          strength of the Belkan forces Galm Team encountered led PJ to surmise that they were not part of any remnant
          resistance movement, and that the "war [was] not over yet."
        </p>
        <p>
          On December 25, the terrorist organization A World With No Boundaries used the commandeered XB-0 Hresvelgr
          gunship to launch surprise attacks on the city of Lumen and Valais Air Base. Despite damage to the base
          facilities and runway, Galm Team took off in pursuit of the XB-0 and eventually intercepted it over the
          Waldreich Mountains. The gunship's fighter escorts, which included Espada Team, engaged Galm but were
          ultimately shot down. Cipher proceeded to disable the XB-0's engines and numerous anti-aircraft weapons,
          rendering the gunship defenseless. The ultimate destruction of its cockpit caused the XB-0 to lose altitude
          and crash. Pixy, who had since fallen in with the terrorist group, then relayed a coded transmission to
          Galm Team, which PJ deciphered: "Yo, Buddy. You still alive?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Six days later, on December 31, Galm Team was dispatched to Mund Valley in central Belka, where A World With
          No Boundaries had taken control of the Avalon Dam facility and its V2 warhead. In order to expedite its
          arrival at the target area, Galm embarked on a course that took it through Area B7R once more. Upon entering
          the airspace, Cipher and PJ were engaged by several ace squadrons from the terrorist group, including Gault
          Team, which was led by A World With No Boundaries' (supposed) leader, Anton Kupchenko. After a heated
          dogfight, Cipher downed the enemy fighters, and Galm continued on towards Mund.
        </p>
        <p>
          After arriving at the operation airspace, Galm and several other Allied squadrons approached the dam facility
          at low altitude through the river valley, while other Allied aircraft overhead drew fire from the dam's
          anti-aircraft defenses. Upon reaching the dam, Cipher flew into the facility's subterranean tunnels and
          destroyed the three modules controlling the V2 launch. As Cipher and PJ prepared to depart, Pixy―piloting
          an advanced ADFX-02 Morgan―appeared and opened fire with his fighter's Tactical Laser System, hitting and
          killing PJ. Pixy then radioed Cipher, asking if he had "found a reason to fight yet" and began to
          reactivate the V2 launch sequence. The two mercenaries fought over Avalon, with Cipher slowly stripping the
          Morgan of its weaponry until Foulke activated the aircraft's ECM shielding. However, Cipher landed several
          hits on the Morgan's forward air intakes, injuring Foulke and forcing him to eject.
        </p>
        <p>
          Following this final confrontation, Cipher effectively vanished from official records. Foulke is known to have
          survived his injuries and later returned to service as a soldier for hire in Usea.

        <p>
          Sol Squadron, officially the 68th Experimental Squadron, is an experimental unit serving with the
          Erusean Air and Space Administration. The squadron saw deployment during the Lighthouse War. It was featured
          as the main antagonist squadron for most of the campaign of Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mihaly A. Shilage, the squadron's leader, accepted his Erusean status but the other Sol pilots continued to
          wear the Voslagian Air Force emblem on their flight suits. After Mihaly was shot down, Sol Squadron flew
          alongside the Long Range Strategic Strike Group during Operations Daredevil and Hush.
        </p>
        <h4>History</h4>
        <p>
          At the onset of the war, Sol Squadron was formed to support Mihaly on his combat sorties. On May 30, 2019,
          Mihaly flew solo during Osea's Operation Dual Wielder to check on the Erusean drones deployed on the front
          lines. He shot down Gargoyle 1 and Golem 2 before retreating from the airspace. The combat physically strained
          him, so the squadron did not deploy again for over a month.
        </p>
        <p>
          On July 12, Mihaly, Wit, and Seymour joined a formation of Erusean drones chasing the Osean reconnaissance
          squadrons Cyclops and Strider away from Stonehenge. The three Sol pilots reached them in Yinshi Valley, where
          Spare Squadron was attempting to escort Cyclops and Strider. Mihaly engaged and killed Spare 8 as well as
          another Spare pilot and one recon pilot before Trigger engaged him in a dogfight through the valley. Tabloid
          engaged Wit and Seymour simultaneously to prevent them from chasing Trigger or the other Oseans. All of Sol
          Squadron eventually retreated from the area after heavy thunderclouds continued to roll in.
        </p>
        <p>
          The squadron remained grounded for another two months while Dr. Schroeder ordered a new flight suit for Mihaly
          to support his flying style. Schroeder was instantly amazed by Mihaly's control on his aircraft while using
          the new suit; the other Sol members couldn't keep up with their leader.
        </p>
        <p>
          Osea launched a large-scale invasion of Erusea's capital, Farbanti, on September 19. Erusea called on the
          entirety of Sol Squadron to provide backup; the squadron arrived after Osea had already captured the majority
          of Farbanti's territory. Mihaly managed to sink multiple Osean ships, prompting Osean headquarters to order
          Cyclops and Strider Squadrons to shoot him down. Trigger and Wiseman jointly engaged Mihaly after he shot down
          Fencer. Wiseman drew Mihaly through Farbanti's submerged district until Mihaly killed him. Trigger continued
          to engage Mihaly, but Mihaly and the rest of Sol Squadron retreated after both sides lost communications,
          leaving Farbanti in Osean hands.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the collapse of Erusea's government, Sol Squadron chose to desert from Erusea and instead defend
          refugees amassed at Shilage and Voslage; the squadron reformed itself as part of the Voslagian Air Force. When
          Strider Squadron arrived on October 24 to secure Shilage's stockpiled supplies for themselves, Sol deployed
          and attempted to defend the area. Trigger shot down Roald and Hermann—their subsequent fates are left
          unexplored—before Mihaly arrived in an experimental X-02S Strike Wyvern. Mihaly ordered Wit and Seymour to
          leave and stay alive for the sake of their homeland. Trigger engaged Mihaly in an extended dogfight until
          Trigger finally shot him down. Mihaly asked on an open channel for Trigger to "put a stop to the drone
          production" before his radio cut out; he survived his injuries but was crippled and could no longer fly.
        </p>
        <p>
          One week later, Avril Mead put out a call for those looking to end the war to help retake the International
          Space Elevator from Erusean radicals. Wit and Seymour responded under the Voslagian flag to support the Oseans
          and Eruseans fighting the radicals. The two proved useful to their former rivals; they revealed that Erusea's
          drones were flying in slave mode alongside radical pilots, and Wit provided a way to destroy the Arsenal Bird
          by explaining where to attack it. After two ADF-11F Ravens entered the airspace to shoot down the coalition
          forces, Wit and Seymour retreated to a friendly airbase until the coalition returned the next day. The two
          pilots joined the others in fighting the Ravens, observing that they flew precisely like Mihaly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seymour always survives the final battle against the Ravens, but Wit's fate depends on the player. If the
          player manages to shoot down both Ravens at around the same time, Wit will survive the fight. Otherwise, the

          SACS, also known as the Alicorn Squadron, was the Erusean Navy air group from the submarine Alicorn, which saw
          deployment near the end of Operation Sighthound and during Operation Fisherman. The squadron launched via an
          aircraft deck on the top of the submarine's hull. The tail of SACS aircraft bore a design of an alicorn.
        </p>
        <p>
          In line with the radical ideology of their captain, Matias Torres, SACS seemed to display a fanatical devotion
          to their cause. A flight launched purely as a distraction did so willingly and shouted "salvation" just before
          their aircraft exploded.
        </p>
        <h4>History</h4>
        <p>
          At the climax of Operation Sighthound, Torres announced that both he and the Alicorn were no longer under
          Erusean authority. After launching the submarine and destroying an OMDF fleet led by the OFS Puffin, Torres
          launched a flight from the SACS unit, diverting the attention of Osea's fighter squadrons away from the
          Alicorn as it submerged. One of the SACS aircraft carried a cruise missile armed with a WMD. Trigger pursued
          the flight and shot the plane down before it could leave the area of operation and carry out the flight's
          mission.
        </p>
        <p>
          The remaining aircraft of the squadron would launch days later on September 14, when the Osean Navy tried to
          trap the submarine in the Spring Sea. Initially operating as interceptors alongside the Alicorn's detachment
          of SLUAVs, SACS engaged Specter Squadron in an attempt to shoot down their fleet of P-1 patrol aircraft to
          cover the submarine's escape, but this attempt failed when the LRSSG successfully defended Specter. After the
          Alicorn was forced to surface, the remaining aircraft of SACS were launched from the submarine, once again
          alongside SLUAVs, this time as a distraction to try to prevent the LRSSG from destroying the Alicorn.
          Ultimately, SACS failed to prevent the LRSSG from destroying the submarine, resulting in the loss of all on
          board.

        <p>The 126th Tactical Fighter Squadron "Silber" was an squadron of the Belkan Air Force. Known for a
          history of military victories and successes, Silber was one of the oldest known squadrons of the
          BAF.
        </p>
        <h4>History</h4>
        <p>
          Originally named the "105th Tactical Fighter Squadron", the current Silber Squadron was born when Dietrich
          Kellerman was assigned to the team around 1973. The "first season Silber Team" (as Kellerman's original
          formation was retroactively called) fought in the Rectan Conflict in the same decade, defeating the Rectan Air
          Force in an engagement over the Mainz Mountains and allowing the Belkan Army to capture the Rectan capital of
          Cor.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1985, the unit became involved in the Wellow Incident, destroying several unknown aircraft that flew over
          Crescene Island in North Belka. Five years later, in 1990, Dietrich retired from the Belkan Air Force, leaving
          the Silber team (the "second season Silber team") to continue without him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Belkan War
          When the Belkan War broke out in 1995, Kellerman was called back to the frontlines to bolster troop morale. He
          returned to active duty with several pilots from the 9th Special Education Course, the "Kellerman
          Institution", giving birth to the third iteration of the Silber Squadron.
        </p>
        <p>
          In their last combat action, the reformed Silber Squadron was sent as reinforcements during the Second Battle
          of B7R in May 28. The unit was engaged by the 66th Air Force Unit "Galm", and was completely destroyed.
          Kellerman survived. Dubbed the "squadron of tragedy", the battle saw the death of most of the team's pilots,
          causing Kellerman to permanently retire from aviation.

        <p>Garuda Team, officially the 28th Fighter Squadron, is a squadron in the Republic of Emmeria Air Force's
          Eastern Air Region Air Defense. It serves in the REAF's 8th Air Division, and is stationed at Gracemeria Air
          Force Base.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the Emmeria-Estovakia War, Garuda Team became invaluable to the Emmerian war effort as it helped decide
          the outcome of many crucial battles during the war, forcing Estovakia's armed forces to dedicate entire
          operations to the destruction of the squadron. Garuda's renown resulted in its members becoming national
          heroes for the Emmerian people and helping Emmeria emerge victorious in the war.
        </p>
        <p>
          Garuda Team is the player's squadron throughout Ace Combat 6: Fires of Liberation.
        </p>
        <h4>History</h4>
        <p>
          Garuda Team was formed in 2013 upon Talisman's assignment to the Eastern Air Defense Division. The squadron
          was tasked with defending Gracemeria, Emmeria's capital city, from any possible attack. Until mid-2015, the
          squadron was solely comprised of Talisman.
        </p>
        <p>
          On August 30, 2015, Estovakia launched their invasion of Gracemeria. During the emergency scramble, AWACS
          Ghost Eye assigned Marcus Lampert, callsign Shamrock, to the squadron as Talisman's wingman.
        </p>
        <p>
          Garuda Team, along with the rest of the Emmerian forces, fought valiantly to defend Gracemeria. They nearly
          drove out the Estovakian invaders, but were forced to retreat after the P-1112 Aigaion wiped out large
          portions of the defending forces and the elite Strigon Team entered the battle. During the retreat, one of
          Garuda's pilots managed to damage Strigon Leader Victor Voychek's aircraft; he was forced to eject, injuring
          his legs in the process and ending his flight career.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the loss of major cities and key locations to Estovakian forces, Garuda Team was forced to retreat to
          Khesed Island, an island to the west of the Emmerian mainland. They regrouped there with other Emmerian forces
          to make a stand against Estovakia's invasion.
        </p>
        <p>
          On November 24, Estovakia sent a squadron of bombers to destroy Vitoze and the Emmerian forces stationed
          there. Garuda Team was sent up with other air squadrons to defend the city from the approaching bombers. They
          were successful in this operation, allowing Emmeria to begin drafting plans for a counterattack.
        </p>
        <p>
          Three days later, Emmerian forces began their counterattack. They aimed to penetrate Estovakia's defensive
          line in Sipli Field, leading to the battle of Sipli Field. This was Garuda Team's first operation in which the
          squadron supported Emmerian ground troops on multiple fronts. Garuda successfully provided close air support,
          allowing the ground troops to retake Sipli.
        </p>
        <p>
          Garuda Team then participated in the battle of Bartolomeo Fortress a month later, supporting Emmeria's ground
          troops as they retook the fortress and regained control of the island. During the battle, two members of
          Strigon Team attempted to provide support to the stationed Estovakian troops, but Garuda shot down both
          Strigon pilots.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shamrock, whose legs were damaged in the crash, was confined to a wheelchair until he began physical
          rehabilitation, likely grounding him permanently. He visited Melissa Herman's home after the war concluded in
          order to meet her and Matilda since their assistance helped them destroy the Chandelier in his final
          sortie. It is not known if Talisman retired as well, or still served in Emmeria's Air Force for some time
          after the war.

        <p>
          Spare Squadron, officially the 444th Fighter Squadron, is a former penal military unit in the Osean Air
          Defense
          Force, formerly under the command of Colonel D. McKinsey. The unit is comprised of Osean military personnel
          who
          have committed some form of crime. Members of this squadron are considered expendable by the Osean Defense
          Forces. Following Operation Flush, Spare Squadron was recognized as a legitimate Osean Air Force squadron and
          all members were pardoned.
        </p>
        <p>
          The squadron had no standardized aircraft, but all planes were decorated with "sin lines" on the tails in the
          form of white dashes blocking out previous unit decals. The number of marks depended on the severity of the
          crime committed. Spare Squadron was first stationed at the 444th Air Base in Zapland and was later transferred
          to Tyler Island.
        </p>

        <h4>History</h4>
        <p>
          Spare Squadron was formed sometime in May 2019 when a concept of the penal unit was proposed by Colonel
          McKinsey. In May 17, the prisoners were transported to Zapland where the 444th Air Base was functioned as
          their base of operations.
        </p>
        <p>
          In June 2019, Erusean Air Force bombers fell for the Osean facade and began conducting bombing operations on
          the decoy 444th Air Base in Zapland. In order to make the base seem more legitimate, Spare Squadron was
          assembled for the sole purpose of deceiving the Erusean military. The squadron was deployed multiple times
          during this period.
        </p>
        <p>
          Following Operation Lighthouse Keeper, Trigger was tried and found guilty of assassinating former President
          Vincent Harling and transferred to Spare Squadron. Shortly after his transfer, Erusean bombers started bombing
          the base once again, believing the Osean Air Force was concentrated on it. Spare was sent up without access to
          their weaponry. During the battle, contact with Colonel McKinsey was lost, prompting AWACS Bandog to allow
          Spare access to their weaponry. Trigger almost singlehandedly shot down all bombers shortly afterward.
        </p>
        <p>
          After arriving back at base, all squadron members were thrown into solitary by Colonel McKinsey for using
          weaponry without his permission.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eight days after the attack on Roca Roja, Spare was tasked with securing a return route for the Long Range
          Strategic Strike Group squadrons, Cyclops and Strider. Shortly after the destruction of Erusean ground forces
          within Yinshi Valley, both Cyclops and Strider Squadrons entered the airspace while being pursued by MQ-99s.
          Almost singlehandedly, Trigger managed to shoot down the drones and protect the Osean aircraft. Following the
          destruction of the drones, Champ was suddenly engaged by Mihaly A. Shilage who, after a brief exchange of
          maneuvers, shot down and killed him before also downing Spare 10. With the threat of losing more friendlies,
          Bandog ordered Trigger and Tabloid to engage the Su-30SM. A dogfight between Trigger and Mihaly ensued,
          however, it was cut short as clouds were moving in, prompting Sol Squadron to withdraw.
        </p>
        <p>
          Following the successful effort of Cyclops and Strider, Spare was thrown into solitary yet again by McKinsey,
          due to returning without his permission and "failing as escorts".
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to their accomplishments, Spare Squadron was now officially recognized as a legitimate unit within the
          Osean Air Defense Force and all members were pardoned. The majority of the squadron was ordered to relocate to
          Tyler Island, however, Trigger and Count were personally selected by the General Staff Office to escort the
          colonel to Bulgurdarest.
        </p>
        <p>
          On August 5, the majority of Spare Squadron departed from the base and headed west, while McKinsey's
          transport, Roper 1, headed north. While heading towards Bulgurdarest, Trigger sought out and destroyed
          multiple SAM sites across Erusean territory while Count remained nearby Roper 1. During the mission, multiple
          Erusean squadrons approached the transport and were subsequently intercepted and shot down by Trigger and
          Count. After crossing the border into Bulgurdarest, Erusean aircraft withdrew, however, an ADFX-10 quickly
          approached Roper 1 shortly afterward. With the transport under threat, Bandog ordered Trigger to engage the
          aircraft while Count escorted the transport. Despite the ADFX-10's inhuman dog-fighting capabilities, Trigger
          shot down the drone. Cyclops Squadron then entered the airspace and guided McKinsey, along with Spare, back to
          their base.
        </p>
        <p>
          On August 10, Trigger and Count were officially transferred to the Long Range Strategic Strike Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          Believing Tyler Island to have been secured, Spare Squadron and other personnel of the 444th Air Base landed.
          However, the airbase had not yet been secured, and so Spare could not provide air support. Following the
          breakdown of Erusean and Osean communications network, the island fell into chaos, and Spare was at risk of
          attack from both Eruseans defending the island and Oseans mistaking them for a rebelling Osean penal unit.
          They would remain isolated on the island until October 10, when the Long Range Strategic Strike Group would
          arrive and rescue them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Three weeks later, they helped escort refugees into the International Space Elevator. However, Tabloid was
          crushed by falling debris in the process.
        </p>
        <p>
          Following the end of the war, they helped provide supplies for refugees at the Space Elevator.

        <p>
          Mimic Squadron was a mysterious mercenary and assassin unit belonging to GR Guardian Mercenaries. They briefly
          appeared in the first two DLC missions for Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown. Despite bearing Osean emblems, the
          squadron was hostile towards both Osean and Erusean forces They were supposedly hired by former Osean
          Brigadier General Howard Clemens, to assassinate Trigger.
        </p>
        <p>
          The squadron was comprised of the van Dalsen siblings: Otto, callsign "Rage"; and Elke, callsign "Scream".
          Upon the deaths of both siblings, the squadron is believed to no longer exist.
        </p>

        <h4>History</h4>
        <p>
          Sometime before September 4, 2019, Osean Brigadier General Howard Clemens supposedly contracted the siblings
          to assassinate Trigger.
        </p>
        <p>
          During Operation Sighthound on September 4, 2019, as the LRSSG's Strider Squadron cleaned up Erusean aircraft
          threatening their landing fleet, Mimic Squadron appeared on radar posing as Osean forces. They used Osea's
          radio frequencies but did not show proper IFF. This, along with the fact that there were no more scheduled
          reinforcements, lead AWACS Long Caster and Wiseman to identify them as hostile. Rage noted the presence of
          "Three Strikes" and the duo prepared to attack. Scream downed an Erusean aircraft, earning the ire of Rage.
          The siblings bickered before engaging Trigger in a heated dogfight, using their modified aircrafts' ECM
          capabilities to create fake targeting boxes and to break their opponents' lock. Ultimately, the siblings were
          forced to retreat from the battle. Scream went on an open channel to warn Trigger that they would meet again
          and Trigger would die the next time they met.
        </p>
        <p>
          Six days later, during Operation Domino on September 10, 2019, Mimic appeared at Anchorhead just as the
          LRSSG's operation was ending. Armed with stronger ECM and new 'stealth missiles' that didn't trigger missile
          alerts, Rage and Scream once again engaged Strider Squadron. Scream damaged Lanza's aircraft with a stealth
          missile, forcing him to retreat. Mimic then engaged the remaining two Strider pilots, Count and Trigger.
          During the dogfight, their benefactor, Brigadier General Clemens, contacted them and ordered them to withdraw
          from the airspace. Both siblings refused to comply and continued to engage Trigger and Count. Despite their
          technological advantages, Count switched to a secure line to communicate a plan to Trigger - He would draw
          their attention while Trigger dealt the death blow. Count was able to lure the two apart long enough for
          Trigger to shoot them both down without them coming to each other's aid. Both pilots refused to eject and died
          when their aircraft exploded.
